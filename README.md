LaTeX-Character-Sheets-for-Fate
===============================
WARNING:

This project is a work in progress. Character sheets are not yet usable--or at least are untested.


GOALS:

A collection of LaTeX files to create character sheets for Fate Core and Fate Accelerated tabletop role-playing games (both trademarks of Evil Hat, link below).
* Given the nature of Fate, particularly the 'Fate Fractal', these files should provide all you need to print sheets with information-blocks for Aspects, Skills, Approaches, Extras, Stunts, Stress, and Consequences.
* The sheets should contain as many modules as required, and should be able to flexibly accomodate various hacks to the system with little knowledge of LaTeX. E.g. replacing Approaches with Motivations, changing the Skill cap, or defining new kinds of stress.
