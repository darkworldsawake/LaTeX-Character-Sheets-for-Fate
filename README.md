LaTeX-Character-Sheets-for-Fate
===============================
WARNING: This project is a work in progress. Character sheets are not yet usable--or at least are untested.


GOALS:
A collection of LaTeX files to create character sheets for Fate Core and Fate Accelerated tabletop role-playing games (both trademarks of Evil Hat, link below). Given the nature of Fate, particularly the 'Fate Fractal', these files should provide all you need to print sheets with information-blocks for Aspects, Skills, Approaches, Extras, Stunts, Stress, and Consequences.
